The general idea for the application is a mobile application that field engineers could use. 

The application uses NFC technology to scan a tagged device and display the relevant case information to the engineer. 

The general idea being that if you can use NFC tags on your products, it would allow the Field Service agent to simply touch his phone or table to the device they are servicing and see all the details automatically.

The application uses the following technologies:

1. Salesforce Mobile SDK for Service Cloud, Chatter, Security
2. jQuery Mobile for UI components including Side Panel, Lists, Inputs, Buttons, and Navigation
3. HTML5 Canvas for Signature Capture
4. Cordova (PhoneGap) for Device API Access including NFC Plugin, Camera Plugin
